You may be wondering why so many submissions are happening in the last weeks of school. I wish it didn't have to be this way. I recently lost a lot of the financial support that I have been depending on to pay for school. Because of this I have been 
skipping class to work. Unfortunatly this class falls on a list of priorities, including food and a roof over my head. Thankfully I am in a better financial situation now. I took this week off to finish this class. Thanks for your patience.
